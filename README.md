# Python_Tank_Battle by Michael Szemborski
Tank Game written in Python.  Requires Python 3.x and pygame.

Great thanks to Steve Paget for pygame_functions.py...
(...also quite grateful for his ellucidations in his YouTube videos. Definitely put on my list of "Someone I'd like to meet someday.")

Updates in version 9:
Some of the displays on the first page did not line up as well elsewhere as on the original machine, so the layout was changed.
Also, for the same reason, the Player 2 score was moved left somewhat.

One caveat...
The code is not pretty, but it works. Maybe more time will be spent on it in the future.
